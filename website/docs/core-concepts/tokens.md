# Tokens
Kavach being a authentication and identity management application for it security and having control over entities is very much important. For this purpose Tokens ( Tokens and API Tokens are used interchangeably) are used. Tokens are managed at all levels in Kavach.

- Only owners have access to create, view or delete the tokens.
- Tokens can only be viewed once for security reasons.
 
## How tokens are used at each level:

### Organisation
- In organisation, tokens can be used make the organisation more secure. For example - we can users for tokens to keep track of their actions and have better control over them. We can also use tokens to invite users.
### Application
- Dega is a factly application which helps in managing content. In Dega, we have a Dega-API service which can only be accessed by users which have the access token generated from Kavach. This helps us to add a security layer as well as with the help of tokens we can use analytics to have more details about the applications entities.
### Space
- Space is mainly about managing entities for a website. Tokens help us to keep track of what, how much and which entities have been created, deleted, updated or viewed in the space.

Depending on your used case, you can use tokens for different purposes depending on your needs.
