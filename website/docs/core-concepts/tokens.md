# Tokens
API tokens allow a user to authenticate with cloud apps and bypass two-step verification and SSO, and retrieve data from the instance through REST APIs.
  
- Owners can create API-Tokens so that other users can access the services provided by the API.
- Owners can also revoke the API tokens. Once revoked that API token cannot be used again.

- Token can be created by navigating to the *Application* page and then click on the edit action for the application you want to add API-key. After that click on the *New api key* button at the bottom and then fill out the form. 
 
Following are the details required for creating an API-token:

- Name
- Description
